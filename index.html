										I am highly interesting in pursuing a career in software development. I have been programming for a number of years, and am passionate about creating new and innovative projects. I have experience with a wide array of languages including C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, PHP, Swift, C# and Objective-C. I am primarily focused on pursuing web development and mobile app development. Some of the projects that I have created are listed below. They have been created at hackathons, in my various internships, and as side projects. I am interested in pursuing software development in the future through internships or co-ops.

										From a young age, I have always had a love for design. While I initially started with creating traditional art in the form of portraits, my artist capabilities have extended to digital design as well Whilst participating in my internships, I was able to not only develop software, but design it as well. I possess a keen eye for design, and my work has been praised by several UI and UX designers I have had the pleasure of working with. I would love to further my aptitude for design, and am enamored by how modern and beautiful the applications we use today have become. I am interested in further my career by producing software that is not only functional, but beautiful.

										Through my time as a student at Boston Universities, I have demonstrated my leadership capabilities in multiple capacities. Most recently, I am currently serving as the iOS and Android development lead for a team of twenty students in Boston University's Global App Initiative. Our team is building two applications, in iOS and Android, for Boston University's local radio station. I have provided guidance in terms of programmin for the team as well as coordinated effots between the Business, Design, iOS, and Android subgroups within the team. I find project management to be quite fulfilling and would be interested in continuing with similar roles.

									<p class="modal-p">The French Quarter Festival is the world's largest free music festival located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The number of participants is generally around 750,000. The application has over 25,000 downloads and has over a 4 star rating on the app store.
									<br>
									This application was constructed in a six person team in Xcode utilizing Swift, Objective-C, HTML, and CSS. We also used Parse and SQLite in order to construct our database and AppleMaps to fuel the newly added Map feature of our map. Moreover, we used various CocoaPods in order to achieve tasks such as parsing through JSON or completing UI testing.
									<br>
									The application is currently available on the iTunes app store.

									<br>
									<center><img width="640" height="360" src="img/dropInPreview.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></center>
									<p class="modal-p">
									DropIn is an application focused on promoting water sustainability. DropIn encourages its users to find tap water in their area rather than use water bottles. It shows public water fountains across the country and also allows users to add new locations and rate current locations. Also, information from BeCause Water, such as blog posts and merchandise, is also available on the application.
									<br>
									The DropIn application is both an iOS and Android application, and there is a webapp version available on dropinapp.org. My primary responsibility was working on the iOS application. I first redid the entire UI of the application to better resemble Apple standards, and moved the maps portion of the project onto the Native Apple Maps. I dealt with the database in MySQL and PHP in order to allow users to store their profile information when they logged in. Moreover, I added in ApplePay so that users were able to buy items from BeCause Water directly from the application. 
									<br>
									The old version (very primitive) of DropIn is currently available on the iTunes app store.

									insIGhtful is a web application that was created at Hack UMass 2015. It was created with the purpose of allowing businesses to track how well their hashtag and brand is trending on social media, particularly on Instagram. With a simple search of a hashtag, photos are shown showing statistics about the images including basic information drawn from Instagram, as well as sentiment analysis from IBM's Alchemy sentiment analysis API.
									<br>
									insIGhtful was created using Javascript (jQuery, D3), HTML, CSS, the Instagram API, and IBM's alchemy API.

									<p class="modal-p">
									Raven is an application created to allow doctors and patients better assess mental health via social media. Using Facebook, Raven allows doctors to connect to their patient's Facebook information in order to analyze posts for mental health. Specific trends for eleven of the most popular medical illnesses (i.e. bipolar, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder) are scanned via the algorithm we created and the results are graph in a beautiful UI for the doctor to see the results. Doctors and patients are able to log on periodically in order to check on their status reports.
									<br>
									Raven was created with Javascript (D3.js/jQuery/Chart.js), Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and various Indico NLP APIs. The mental illnesses algorithms were developed by researching various different illnesses, picking out warning signs which could be detected via text, and applying these to the results obtained from the Indico APIs.
									<br>
									Raven is currently deployed <a href = "http://yraven.herokuapp.com">here</a>. A valid Facebook account is needed to log in.

									<p class="modal-p">
									Kinect Your Blackboard is a web application paired with a Microsoft Kinect that allows users to transcribe hand movements verified by the Microsoft Kinect. In order to "type" a letter into the web application, users must make the shape a letter (i.e. A). The coordinates of the letter are then sent from the Kinect to our web application, where the coordinates are then drawn as a picture, recognized via computer vision, and then converted to text. Users have the ability to then save any text they may have created, via previous text, and more. There is also the capability for users to log in and out. 
									<br>
									Kinect Your Blackboard was created using C# with the Kinect, Node.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the web application. 
									<br> 
									Kinect Your Blackboard can be viewed <a href="http://scarlethestevez.me/KINECTHACKS/index.html">here</a>. Please note logging in has been enabled for all users for ease of viewing.
